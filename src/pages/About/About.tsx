              <p>
                Franklin Lakes Special Education Parent Advisory Group (SEPAG) is dedicated to supporting 
                families of students with special needs in our community. We work collaboratively with 
                the Franklin Lakes School District to ensure that every child receives the education and 
                support they deserve.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our organization provides advocacy, education, and support services to families navigating 
                the special education system. We believe that every child has the right to a quality 
                education that meets their unique needs and helps them reach their full potential.
